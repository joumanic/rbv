      <h2 className="form-title">Thank You for Your Submission!</h2>
      <b className="form-description">AFTER YOUR SHOW HAS AIRED:</b>
      <b>What we do:</b>
      <b>We upload all shows to our Soundcloud archive within 72 hours of them airing</b>
<p>What we ask from you:</p> 

<li> Share the link to your Soundcloud show on your socials if you use them and
repost to your own Soundcloud account if you have one </li>
<li>Make and share a track list of what you played </li>
 <li>Tag any artists or labels that you featured in your show. It might start a
conversation and who knows where it could go!</li>

<p classname="form-description">Some of our shows are one-offs, some are semi -regular and some go on to become
regular monthly or bi-monthly residencies and we will be back in touch with you if you
are being invited back to to a repeat show. Please note again we are a very small team
still and this can take us longer than we would like. Hosts will have presented at least
3 shows before being considered for a regular residency and as we mentioned before,
factors like meeting deadlines and turning up on time are also taken into
consideration.</p>
<p classname="form-description">We hope you enjoyed doing your show on Radio Buena Vida. If you have any
feedback or suggestions on how we can do things better please drop us an email to
radio@buenavida.co.uk</p>

<p classname="form-description">Warm wishes,</p>

<p classname="form-description">Team RBV</p>
